*Traveling and getting to know new cultures is an activity I value a lot, so far __I lived more than ten years abroad__ (Poland since 7 months, Germany for 11 years and France for the rest). Moving to a new country and the required adaptability and flexibility have become a second nature for me. Spending time abroad allowed me to become more open-minded and adaptable. In the upcoming years I'd like to move to Canada <font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'canadian-maple-leaf']" />, New Zealand or Australia to further improve those skills and challenge myself even further*

### <font-awesome-icon icon="server"/> Short summary of my SysAdmin Experience
During my apprenticeship I was the only Sysadmin in the company, setting up maintaining and securing servers and services but also managing users.

Amongst other tools and services, I deployed Rocket.Chat (<font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'rocketchat']" />) for the communication between the company and external contributors (a few hundred users in total), different mail servers (courier IMAP → Dovecot) and Webhosting Services (Confixx → Plesk migration, Apache / Nginx), ... I automated tasks using Bash and several CLI tools (IMAPsync, mjml.io ...).

In the middle of my apprenticeship, I decided to change the company to join OVHcloud.
My final project for the apprenticeship was setting up a clustered ELK-Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash) to monitor a fleet of machines and gain more insights about the performance of those machines.

I've been the administrator of a gîte in Alsace (France) for more then 10 years, tasks included:
- setting up the wifi: design the deployment, cable management, setting up the Access Points (Unifi), Setting up the Firewall (pfsense) and the VLANs, ... 
- managing the backup and data storage strategy on the NAS (Synology)
- setting up the computers and managing them (<font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'apple']" />, <font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'windows']" />, <font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'linux']" />) using tools such as JAMF, teamviewer, ...
- creating, translating and maintaining the website (based on wordpress)

*System Administration or Project Management are directions in which I would like to pursue my career. Having some experience in different fields allows me to have a good insight and a more in-depth understanding of underlying issues that can be faced when managing a project, or to spot difficulties in communication between techies and management and address them.*

*I chose to display an estimation of the real time i spent using the different technologies I encountered, because I think that the time spent working with a specific technology is probably a better metric than a progress bar (and it's more accurate). Next to it is how I would assess my skills*

## <font-awesome-icon icon="user-astronaut"/> Hobbies
I enjoy practising sports (skiing, golf and downhill mountainbiking :bike:), reading thrillers :books: and listening to music.
Both reading and sports give me the focus needed to maintain a good work/life balance required when working in IT.
Globally speaking I'm always keen to learn and on finding out how to further improve my skills and workflows be it when doing my hobbies or working.
